# Plant_Disease_Detection_System
Our aims are to identify the state of the art, with the use of convolutional neural networks (CNN) in the process of identification and classification of plant diseases. With the help of CNN, we can be able to diagnose the disease as well as the best cure for plant.

# Steps for Run the project
1) start the Main.py file from the code folder (run on python IDLE).
2) After that open the frontend folder and then run the "npm start" command on the command prompt.
3) Then wait for a while it will automatically start.
